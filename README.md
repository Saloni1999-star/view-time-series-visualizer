#  Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification**. It focuses on visualizing time series data through line plots, bar plots, and box plots to observe trends, seasonality, and distribution of data over time.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning on time series data  
- Generate a line plot to visualize daily page views  
- Create a bar plot showing monthly averages grouped by year  
- Build box plots to analyze year-wise and month-wise distribution  

---

##  Dataset

The dataset `fcc-forum-pageviews.csv` contains daily page view data for the freeCodeCamp Forum between 2016 and 2019.

**Columns**:
- `date`: Date of observation  
- `value`: Number of page views

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- numpy  
- datetime  

---

##  Tasks Performed

- Cleaned outliers using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles  
- Plotted a **line chart** to show page views over time  
- Plotted a **bar chart** to show average monthly views grouped by year  
- Created two **box plots**:
  - Year-wise trend distribution  
  - Month-wise seasonality pattern  

---

##  Visualizations

1. **Line Plot** ‚Äì Daily page views from 2016 to 2019  
2. **Bar Plot** ‚Äì Average monthly page views per year  
3. **Box Plots** ‚Äì  
   - Year-wise distribution of page views  
   - Month-wise seasonality of views
